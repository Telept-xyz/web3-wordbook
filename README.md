# web3-wordbook

## what is this project used for?
For most of the newbies, he/she will face the knowledge catch-up phase as long as he/she sees so many wonderful new words. 



## who can edit the book and how?
Everyone can! Web3 is a open world for everyone to participate, and we believe this will make the definition in a transparent way as well.

The wordbook is structured by 
- index: works.json
- item: the corresponding definition in the books folder.

### if you want to add a new word
First in first, please double check the words.json. The word you try to add might be already there.

If not, you need to create a book for this new word inside books folder, and name it, for example, abc.json. Then, update words.json to add this word and the created book "abc.json". 

Submit the PR and you are done!
